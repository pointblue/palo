# palo

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This R package contains functions useful for analysis of data collected at the Palomarin Field Station and closely-associated monitoring programs.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of `palo` (in development) from [Github](https://github.com/PointBlue/palo) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("pointblue/palo")
```

## Example Stub

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(palo)
## basic example code to be filled in
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
# summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
# plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
