<!-- badges: end -->

This R package contains functions useful for analysis of data collected
at the Palomarin Field Station and closely-associated monitoring
programs.

## Installation

When released, you will be able to install the latest version of palo
from [Github](https://github.com/PointBlue/palo) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("pointblue/palo")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(palo)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
# summary(cars)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
