This R package contains useful functions for analyzing data collected at
the Palomarin Field Station and closely-associated monitoring programs.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of `palo` (in development) from
[Github](https://github.com/PointBlue/palo) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("pointblue/palo")
```

Fitting the BBS-style hierarchical models requires also installing
[JAGS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/).

## Example Stub

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(palo)
#> Loading required package: rjags
#> Loading required package: coda
#> Linked to JAGS 4.3.0
#> Loaded modules: basemod,bugs
## basic example code to be filled in
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
# summary(cars)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
